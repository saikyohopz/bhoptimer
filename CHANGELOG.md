## zone stuff
- main commits https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/e3aac2d24efc239cf8bc6d1296f0ede031b7f0b1 https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/4315221b86889c65c2b35d9d07bf3241e4c57315
- new cvars:
	- `shavit_zones_usesql`: Whether to automatically load zones from the database or not. If you're using standardized zones from some source with `shavit-zones-http`, then you'd change this cvar to `0` for example.
	- `shavit_zones_useprebuilt`: Whether to automatically hook `trigger_multiple` zones like `climb_zone*` and `mod_zone*`.
	- `shavit_zones_usebuttons`: Whether to automatically hook `climb_*` buttons...
- you can now hook trigger_multiples, func_buttons, and trigger_teleports by their hammerids or by `targetname` (trigger_multiple/func_button) / `target` (trigger_teleport).
	- trigger_teleports should usually be hooked by hammerid because hooking by target is a bit iffy.
	- there's a menu that shows all the hookable things and the player's distance to them. also a menu option to hook the thing the player is looking at...
	- oh yeah, it's `sm_hookzone` and also in the Timer Commands menu
- `shavit-zones-http.sp` added. maybe sourcejump can use it or something.
	- this plugin is also a good example of how to use the new APIs for adding zones from other plugins.
	- The dependencies & headers (sm-json & ripext) for this plugin are not included in the bhoptimer repo. You'll have to retrieve them yourself for now if you intend to compile this.
- zone points are now be normalized (sql migration and when sending to db). corner1 turns into the zone mins and corner2 turns into the maxs.
- a `"speed"` zone config thing was added for zones. you can add this key to `shavit-zones.cfg` to make zone beam textures move.
- api and stuff:
	- `zone_cache_t` is now usable for adding zones from other plugins.
		- forward `Shavit_LoadZonesHere()` is where you should add `zone_cache_t`'s from other plugins
	- removed `Shavit_GetStageZone()` as it doesn't work well with multiple stage zones.
	- added `Shavit_ReloadZones()`, `Shavit_UnloadZones()`, `Shavit_GetZoneCount()`, `Shavit_GetZone()`, `Shavit_AddZone()`, and `Shavit_RemoveZone()`
	- `MAX_ZONES` 64->128. `MAX_STAGES` 51->69.

## everything else
- added an option to use an duplicate other players' checkpoints (#1142) @sh4hrazad https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/487e3db9d09d704b67f66e928fcd36adfd990abf
	- You can toggle this with `shavit_checkpoints_useothers` (default: 1)
	- new parameters added to `Shavit_OnTeleportPre`, `Shavit_OnTeleport`, `Shavit_OnSavePre`, `Shavit_OnSave`, `Shavit_OnCheckpointMenuSelect`, and `Shavit_TeleportToCheckpoint`
- changed czone settings to let all zone types be configurable. made the settings for bonuses apply to every bonus https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/ab73e36a15bc426f4edeec13b8d44e8dffacd522
- added `Zone_Speedmod` so oblivious could have fun bonuses https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/acf47a11b1aa10ceaaaa1555e58611efca452098
	- avoid putting these inside of entites that trigger a map's `player_speedmod` because they'll probably override each other randomly
	- also gravity zones should show the gravity amount in zone edit menus now
- added the `!maprestart` & `!mapreload` aliases https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/a23348d843b623183aa3538ad67be6e9d5ee4446
- add csgo stripper:source configs for `workshop/2117675766/bhop_craton`, `workshop/1195609162/bhop_bless`, and `workshop/859067603/bhop_bless` https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/d816423eb69c1c199d1034b39e7412ad94abe17f
	- also a config for a shit `mod_zone_start` on `bhop_n0bs1_css` was added
- added `ent_fire` to cheat commands list since it can be used on csgo https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/bc62b92983f829e84c7f1c06af37b237dc0214ae

	- +`Shavit_SetAutogainBasicStrafer`, +`Shavit_GetAutogainBasicStrafer`, `sm_autogainbss`, `+/-autogainbss`

- the player's current value from `player_speedmod`s is now reset to 1.0 on timer start. this shouldn't affect many things but it does help on `deathrun_steam_works` https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/8f11f9aaf157037f41607da0e7d9bd5a7157fe07

# v3.2.0 - checkpoints & resettargetname stuffffff - 2022-04-27 - rtldg
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v3.2.0
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/7c842afdf05e6c9b37174d7b1d6e21d685f6ce57

Lots of checkpoint API changes and also lots of changes to how the `shavit_misc_resettargetname` family works.

**Protip: If you don't have `eventqueuefix` on your server then you're going to suffer** through booster exploits & other broken shit.

**Update shavit-mapfixes.cfg every release.** It wasn't ever explicitly mentioned in release notes so I'll put it here.

Maps that have triggers in the start zone for resetting targetnames & classnames should now activate with @GAMMACASE's changes (#1123 / #1135) to the `shavit_misc_resettargetname` family, compared to previously where it wiped all events in the startzone and had a lot of cvars added to shavit-mapfixes.cfg to unbreak the maps.

If you have any new breakage on maps, let us know in the discord server or with a Github issue.

- some wip csgo hud stuff and more forwards 3295e235534828eddff10f68b8b55c965d4a35c7 7675b605673c827db8f7987ecb5f92b880aedaf2

	- `tas_timescale`
		- greater than `0.0` = forced tas-timescale on this style (example: `"tas_timescale" "0.5"`)
		- `-1` = players can change their timescale manually
		- The implementation was based on [KiD-TAS](https://github.com/kidfearless/KiD-TAS/tree/rewind)
	- `autostrafe`
		- `-1` = players can toggle between the 1-tick autostrafer & the autogain velocity based one
		- `1`  = 1-tick autostrafer from @xutaxkamay (retrieved from [KiD-TAS](https://github.com/kidfearless/KiD-TAS/tree/rewind))
		- `2`  = faux autostrafer that gives velocity from @defiy (retrieved from [defiy/autogain](https://github.com/defiy/autogain))
		- `3`  = faux autostrafer that gives velocity (no speed loss version (for fun high speed turns)) from @defiy
			- not a "legit" tas mode since impossible turns are possible.
	- `autoprestrafe`
		- TAS Prestrafer for maximum ground movement speed.
	- `edgejump`
		- Automatically jumps when the player will fall off a ledge next tick.
		- Should jump out of the start-zone with a 0.0 zone offset.
	- `autojumponstart`
		- Automatically jumps when the player will leave the start zone.
	- `"tas" "1"` = Enables the TAS style settings unless they are explicitly disabled:
		- `tas_timescale -1`, `autostrafe 1`, `autoprestrafe 1`, `edgejump 1`, and `autojumponstart 1`
	- +/- timescale options show up in the segmented checkpoints menu when `tas_timescale` is enabled https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/578dd01e1a92295a8863cd9b6d3e486a6d53bd20
	- added `!tasmenu`/`!tasm`, `!ts <number>`, `!tsplus <number>`, and `!tsminus <number>`
	- `+autostrafe`/`-autostrafe`/`!autostrafe`, `+autoprestrafe`/`-autoprestrafe`/`!autoprestrafe`, `+edgejump`/`-edgejump`/`!edgejump`, `+autojumponstart`/`-autojumponstart`/`!autojumponstart`
	- added `Shavit_ShouldProcessFrame()`.
	- added `fplayer_speedmod`, `fNextFrameTime`, and `iLastMoveTypeTAS` to `timer_snapshot_t`

Maybe I should've released some of this sooner as 3.0.9, but oh well.

# v3.0.0 - Fluffytail Edition - 2021-07-29 - rtldg
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v3.0.0
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/9adf78d311192f91ccf32edf9decb72fa1597313

(originally this was going to be v2.7.0 but it took too long and had too many changes so it became v3.0.0 and also the `very_good_yes` was deprecated with the bump to v3.0.0)

## This update breaks plugins using natives with enum structs along with removing some natives. Recompile any plugin that uses shavit.inc. Also `stylesettings_t` was removed so anything that uses that will need to be changed, but it's easy to fix.
## Also, make sure to post any errors or problems you find in the github issue tracker or in the `#timer-support-here` channel of the bhoptimer discord https://discord.gg/jyA9q5k

## Update Notes TL;DR (the most notable things):
- You can now make a total of 8 bonuses.
- `!r` now goes to the most recent track. `!main`/`!m` was added to go to the main track.
- Multiple replay bots can be spawned simultaneously. Also you can make replay bots that loop styles & tracks.
- The `!replay` menu now has options to skip forwards, skip backwards, and play at 2x speed.
- The stage times from the WR run will now be saved (if you add stage zones).
- Support added for [`hermansimensen/eventqueue-fix`](https://github.com/hermansimensen/eventqueue-fix) to allow timescaling map events and help prevent some map exploits.
- Postframes added to replays.
- More efficient time-difference calculation possible with [`rtldg/sm_closestpos`](https://github.com/rtldg/sm_closestpos)
- Times should now be slightly more accurate by basing off tick-interval instead of frame-time.

## Concommands
- added `sm_ccadd <steamid>` and `sm_ccdelete <steamid>` to give ccname&ccmsg access via steamid instead of adding them with admin flags or something (#861). [commit](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/19c5ccb7f38cc793f974a2c118c1c10ccc20e71a)
- `sm_recalcall` and `sm_recalcmap` should be faster now.
- added `sm_toggleadverts` for clients.
- Multiple bonus typo convenience commands added. `sm_b1`, `sm_b2`, etc through to `sm_b8`.
- Multiple stage typo convenience commands added. `sm_s1`, `sm_s2`, etc through `sm_s9`.
- `!r` now resets your timer back to the track you were previously on. `!main`/`!m` was added to move you back to the main track
- `sm_p` has been changed to be an alias of `sm_profile` instead of noclip. You'll probably want to use `sm_nc` now.
	- `sm_noclip` can now be used as an alias of the timer noclip commands. [commit](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/dd756b95cc77eec8cc2ccafd855a86628a213d9e)
- `sm_loadunzonedmap` to load the next unzoned map from the `maps` folder (doesn't include workshop maps or sub-folders).
- `sm_save` will now refresh an open checkpoint menu.

	- Can now checkpoint onto a ladder thanks to `m_vecLadderNormal`.
	- Fixed segmented checkpoints from starting in practice mode sometimes (#1023)
	- Persistent data is now kept when changing map to the same map. This is done because of server hibernation causes map changes a lot on csgo which is annoying.
	- reduced some allocations and ArrayList cloning
	- fixed persistent data & savestates spawning you in the wall if you were ducked in a tunnel.
- Add support for [`hermansimensen/eventqueuefix`](https://github.com/hermansimensen/eventqueue-fix)
	- boosters & map outputs can be saved in checkpoints to prevent cheesability
	- events are paused from running when the timer is paused (although this still needs to be worked on)
- increased top left WR hud buffer size to handle long player names (#1050)
- changed replay bot score from 2000 to 1337 (#1059)
- initial [DynamicChannels](https://github.com/Vauff/DynamicChannels) stuff added (which probably doesn't work too well)

  - edit 2021-11-08: also `speed` and `timescale` both affect styles now since some commit somewhere... slow mo was affected. just remove the `"speed" "0.5"` and it should work how it used to
- Setspawn/setstart for each player added. !sp / !ss / !delss / !delsp (#1028)
- Added velocity difference to the HUD from the closest replay time position. [commit](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/8b48ae8c917f972e18af3a1456ce77e6714ba668)

	- `sm_closestpos(0.000006s)` -- `sourcepawn(0.011590s)` (time needed to locate closest position with a long badges replay i had)
- Added looping, dynamicly spawning, and physics_prop replay bots. [commit](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/9e43f67fc3a66554b3d8ec253332a8b511d1d9d1) (there's many more commits, but that's the initial one)
	- Looping bots will repeat any replays on tracks and styles specified for it in `shavit-replay.cfg`.
	- Dynamic bots allow multiple replay bots to be spawned by different players so replay bot hogging isn't as problematic.
	- Prop replay bots are physics_props that the client spectates and don't take a player slot.
		- Currently does not work well with area portals, func_illusionary stuff, and anything that is generally in a different "area".
	- `bot_join_after_player` is now used to determine whether to spawn bots in an empty server.
		- Here's some relevant convars to disable CS:GO server hibernation or bot-kicking:
		```
		sv_hibernate_postgame_delay 9999999
		sv_hibernate_punt_tv_clients 0
		sv_hibernate_when_empty 0
		bot_auto_vacate 0
		bot_join_after_player 0
		mp_autokick 0
		```
- Removed usage of `bot_quota` and started to call BotAddCommand directly which works really well and is really cool and I love it. bot_quota sucks. [commit](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/57e9072b195ff24fcec9eb28316f2791c72a89d0)
- Replay playback should work a bit better if the tickrate was changed by TickrateControl (#1018).
- Post-run frames / postframes added to replays. [main commit](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/28e9d4029b7010d6933b8d775cb2098c6b09d379)
- usercmd mousex/mousey and forwardmove/sidemove added to replay file.
- When spectating replays, the percentage-complete now goes below 0% for preframes and above 100% for postframes.
- Fixed replay bots teleporting on the last frame of a replay and screwing up prediction.
- the `!replay` menu now includes +1s, -1s, +10s, -10s, and 2x speed options to rewind/fastforward. [commit](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/a2735d8a2a322d6cb25d0617c49ee9563e3a3be9)
- Stage stuff: [initial commit](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/2697e6c5b1ed3de7464f60c7177f4eaba8acc6b6), and [another](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/96281d2f85fb570e15f18ae2ff5038b875763796)
	- prebuilt map stages using mod_zone_checkpoint_X / mod_zone_bonus_X_checkpoint_X work now [commit](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/2d39b90564826fc7fc97172d86868fbfe6bcc3e0)
		- Check out https://github.com/PMArkive/fly#trigger_multiple for the format used for prebuilt map zones

# v2.5.5a - asdf - 2019-08-08 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.5.5a
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/979c911a268f22bd94c930ed7f7722bd8426b326

## As usual, backup your database before ANY update in case something breaks.
## If you're suspicious of server's database being slower than it should be, after updating, follow this procedure:

Note that this only applies to installations where bhoptimer was first installed before the release of v2.5.5.

1. Run the following queries in your database:
```sql
# Note: if you use a table prefix, add it in front of the following keywords: playertimes, pt_auth, chat, ch_auth
ALTER TABLE `playertimes` DROP FOREIGN KEY `pt_auth`;
ALTER TABLE `chat` DROP FOREIGN KEY `ch_auth`;
```

2. Disable the `shavit-rankings` module if it's in use.
3. Start the server, lock it with a password so no one can enter it.
4. Run the command `sm_migration all` with root access.
5. Wait up to 1 minute.
6. Restart the server. If you desire to use the rankings module, enable it again.

Your database should be MUCH faster if it was misconfigured due to failed migrations.

---

* Improved measuring for perfect jumps (scroll styles).
* Added failsafe to prevent data loss when players finish maps when the database is locked.
* Fixed !end not working on maps with trigger zones.
* Fixed trigger zones not working if the running map is the first one since server start.
* Fixed replay plugin causing connect/disconnect messages to not show up.
* Added `sm_migration` command to re-apply database migrations if needed.
* Added logging when wiping player data.
* Added warning message when trying to wipe player data for invalid SteamIDs.
* Minor database optimizations.
* Fixed foreign keys not being removed/added properly for tables with prefixes, in database migrations.

## Console Variables

* `shavit_misc_wrmessages` - change this to set the amount of messages that show up when someone sets a WR. 0 to completely disable the message.

## API
* Added natives: (thanks @kidfearless!)
  * `Shavit_GetClientFrameCount`
  * `Shavit_GetReplayFrames`
* Added forwards:
  * `Shavit_OnFinishMessage` - allows you to modify the finish messages in chat.



# v2.5.5 - asdf - 2019-07-14 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.5.5
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/e4c8be08bc18884236b1b5842df58b83990f0f69

## This update features automatic database migrations. Backup your database and read [this gist](https://gist.github.com/shavitush/cfd329998c3d311ad5879f0052346bcc) before updating.

(gist enclosed in this spoiler text below:)
<details>
	31/05/2019
	if you are running v2.5.5 or above (from very_good_yes branch), there's some good news. unless you're on sqlite of course. if you're on sqlite, you might have to stick to the same version, or recreate your database
	i've added database migration and lots of optimizations, you don't need to do them on your end because the plugin will automatically do them for you!
	*however*, the first batch of database migrations contains 12 migrations, which is a lot. some of them take a while to execute, and some will be pretty much instant

	because of that, when you upgrade to from v2.5.4 or older, to v2.5.5 or newer i ask you to follow the following procedure:

	0. **DO A DATABASE BACKUP!! YOUR DATABASE MIGHT BREAK IF THE MIGRATION IS BEING INTERRUPTED AND YOU WILL LOSE DATA!!**
	1. if you have more than one server running the same database, take them all offline until this process is done
	2. close access to the game server that will perform the database migration. via password, server maintenance plugins, firewall, or whatever solution you can think  of
	3. update the game server to the latest version of bhoptimer, and start it. the server console will show "applying migration..." lines. let it run, it can take from 5 sec up to even 10 minutes, depending on the size of your database and your server's specs
	4. when the migration is done, you should see a `migrations` table in your database with entries from 0 all the way to 11 (as of v2.5.5. newer versions might have more). if you see this, it means that the migration is completed
	5. if the migration is completed, you can shut down the server, remove the password and put it back online :)

	frequent issues when migrating the database:
	```
	Timer (zone refresh) SQL query failed. Reason: Unknown column 'flags' in 'field list'
	```
	- this is fine. the error happens because the zones plugin has no way of knowing if the migration has happened already or not. it should go away right after finishing the migration

	```
	Timer (rankings, update all points) error! Reason: Incorrect integer value: '[U:1:steamid]' for column ..steamid at row X
	```
	- the database migration was interrupted or you haven't closed access to the server while migrating! run it again starting from step 1. i hope you have a backup, otherwise this will be a pain in the ass to fix and i will not manually fix your broken database, sorry.

	if you notice anything weird with the migration, let me know
</details>

Somewhat big update. I'm unmotivated recently so it'll probably be a while until next one.

* `prespeed` setting in style config now supports the value of 2. If it's set to 2, the value of `shavit_core_nozaxisspeed` will be respected by the style.
* Fixed an error that occurs when someone finishes a map without having any sound in the "noimprovement" section.
* Fixed record cache issues when maps have more than 1000 records combined between all styles/modes.
* After opening the KZ menu manually, it will be kept open unless interrupted by other menus.
* Fixed points recalculation for long map names.
* Fixed SQL query issues when using table prefix.
* Fixed foreign key constraints issues when running multiple bhoptimer servers on the same database.
* Added new CS:GO radio commands to the radio block list.
* Split replay loaders for the different kinds of replay formats. (technical change, helps me maintain the code)
* Fixed the very first frame of replays from version 1.4b and below not being played.
* Added `shavit_rankings_llrecalc` cvar, see the section below.
* Optimized chat plugin to not query the database for data saving unless it is needed.
* Added database migrations! Refer to [my gist](https://gist.github.com/shavitush/cfd329998c3d311ad5879f0052346bcc) about it.
* Optimized the database structure by A LOT. Wait a while (depends on how big your database is) after starting the server, after updating. You should wait at least 30 min for big databases before restarting the server.
* Added the ability to force invisible zones to be shown the players. The use case is making glitch zones visible to players while not doing it for all of them.
* Added custom sv_airaccelerate zones.
* Changed the behavior of No Speed Limit zones to Custom Speed Limit. All old zones are unlimited speed limit.
* Added GitHub Sponsors. Sponsoring itself is not usable right now because I'm not accepted yet though.
* Fixed "weapon <num> is not owned by client <num>" error.
* Added tracking for map completions. It is shown in the submenu of a record's details.
* Added "simplerladders", see cvar section.
* Optimized rankings plugin to not query the database for recalculations more times than needed.
* Split database handles per-plugin instead of using the same connection for all of them.
* Fixed sync for HSW. Thanks @Nairdaa!

## Console Variables

* `shavit_rankings_llrecalc` - Maximum amount of time (in minutes) since last login to recalculate points for a player. `sm_recalcall` does not respect this setting. 0 - disabled, don't filter anyone. This setting optimizes recalculation time by a lot.
* `shavit_core_simplerladders` - Allows using all keys on limited styles (such as sideways) after touching ladders. Touching the ground enables the restriction again.



# v2.5.4 - asdf - 2019-04-15 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.5.4
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/88b8b9a0799e95ac4680c20786d3b412f4a6d788

This is a hotfix update with some changes requested shortly after the v2.5.3 update.

* Added `force_groundkeys` style property. It forces the key blocking settings even when on ground. e.g. enabling this on W-Only will not allow prestrafing with the A/D keys.
* Fixed an issue that caused !r to not show up the menu that has "your timer will stop" warning.
* Slight reorganization the checkpoints menu. I moved the reset button one item below, and it now has a confirmation prompt when you try to reset your checkpoints.
* Fixed multiple issues with the KZ menu. Additionally, it will now not keep persisting when manually closed.
* Fixed an issue that caused autobhop WR submenus show the perfect jump %.
* Fixed a query error with the *!rr* command on servers running MySQL 5.7 and `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`. Lower versions, and MariaDB servers are unaffected.



# v2.5.3 - asdf - 2019-04-14 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.5.3
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/2a1914010c943e8cfc4e3c5cfbcf9f22de2c052c

* Added pause button in KZ CP menu.
  * In addition, the KZ CP menu now persists and will re-open in case it disappears.
* Fixed error when a player uses !top before the rankings have been calculated.
* Removed the pointless round restarting logic in the Dynamic Timelimit module.
* Made the default method for zoning to be aiming.
* Added warning that shows up before using functionalities that can stop the timer when your time passes a defined number of seconds. See the new added console variable `shavit_misc_stoptimerwarning`. This is triggered on noclip/stop and style changing commands.
* Added `"noimprovement"` sound config file. The sound will play if you finish the map, but not beating your personal best.

## Console Variables

* `shavit_misc_stoptimerwarning` - the amount of seconds someone's timer needs to have to receive the "your timer will be stopped" warning upon using !stop, !nc or changing their style.

## API

* Added natives:
  * `Shavit_CanPause` - determines whether a player is able to pause or not. A value of 0 means that they can pause or resume their timer. Otherwise, this native retrieves flags: `CPR_ByConVar`, `CPR_NoTimer`, `CPR_InStartZone`, `CPR_NotOnGround`. Sample usage:

```sp
if((Shavit_CanPause(client) & CPR_ByConVar) > 0)
{
    // this code will be executed if the pause cvar is disabled
}
```

* New native behavior:
  * `Shavit_ResumeTimer` - now has a second parameter, `teleport`. True will teleport the player to the position they paused at.

* Added forwards:
  * `Shavit_OnTeleport` - called upon teleporting with a checkpoint
  * `Shavit_OnStopPre` - called when the timer is stopping. Ignored when `Shavit_StopTimer` is called with the `bypass` parameter set to true. Returning `false` here will prevent the timer from stopping.



# v2.5.2 - asdf - 2019-03-29 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.5.2
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/5fb84e6ace5fcd8e39a409550d167e7e1501dc60

* Fixed harmless error that occurs when a player is disconnecting before getting fully in-game.
* Fixed being able to break records by -0.000. Might or might not work. Probably does though.
* Added integrity checks to replay files.
* Fixed minor memory leak caused by loading corrupted replay files.



# v2.5.1 - asdf - 2019-03-29 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.5.1
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/c631f2f549beef5bc5ecad664236c51f03218d65

**Highly** recommended to update if you're on v2.5.0.

* Fixed a game breaking exploit related to persisted data.



# v2.5.0 - asdf - 2019-03-29 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.5.0
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/95d9cad3091003bb0da4c40c92522635604bb233

* **Added `enabled`, `inaccessible` and `kzcheckpoints` style modifiers.**
  * `enabled` - 0 to disable a style, -1 to disable it from being shown in all menus.
  * `inaccessible` - disables manual switching to the style. You may only switch to such a style using external modules (use case is TP mode for KZ).
  * `kzcheckpoints` - enables a new mode for checkpoints. They don't modify the timer, you don't keep your speed and they get reset as soon as you start a new run.
* **Added persisting for timer data (also known as "saveloc") on player disconnection.**
* Optimizations to database structure have been applied. If your initial installation was prior to this release, please follow the [database maintenance](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/wiki/4.3.-Extra:-Database-maintenance) wiki page's instructions.
* Optimizations to database queries have been applied as well.
* Improved cvar enforcing in replay plugin.
* Re-added the "No Speed Limit" text to CS:S HUD.
* Fixed foreign key error in chat module.
* Fixed errors in chat module when running SQLite.

* Fixed WR counter being inaccurate.
* Fixed compatibility with `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` database servers.
* Removed very old table migration code due to it being slow.
* Now !style shows bonus rank 1 times if you're on bonus track.
* Added a decrease button for grid snap during zone setup.
* Added !mapsdone and !mapsleft commands.
* Maps left menu now shows map tier.
* Removed old delete function from admin menu.
* Fixed `mp_humanteam` setting being ignored.
* Changed zone setup to be easier for bonus zones.
* Transition to last frame of the replay will be smoother now.
* Fixed replay HUD bug for styles with speed multipliers.
* Fixed issues with the replay counter for HSW.
* Revamped spawn point addition. It also supports bonus track now.
* Fixed rare bug caused by slow databases.

# Console Variables

* `shavit_misc_hidechatcmds` - hides all commands in chat.
* `shavit_misc_persistdata` - controls minimum time (in seconds) to persist timer data for a player that disconnects.

# API

* Added forwards:
  * `Shavit_OnTeleport` - called upon teleporting with a checkpoint
  * `Shavit_OnSave` - called upon saving a checkpoint



# v2.4.1 - asdf - 2019-03-08 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.4.1
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/a0d205247a5bde6ea7edaf749af4dcad7b21c017

* **Fixed exploit related to checkpoints.**
* **Added `sm_wipeplayer` command.**
* **Added style ordering to menus.** Use `ordering` style config to order styles without changing their IDs.
* **Added the ability to stop replay playback as the requester.**
* **Improved logging of single-record deletion.*
* `!replay` command moves you to spectator, and refers you to the replay bot upon use now.
* Added PB split to HUD. The top-left HUD will split to two sections; "best" and "PB".
* Added map tier to start zone HUD.
* Fixed unintended behavior with checkpoints menu.
* Added the `{rank}` format specifier to custom clan tag console variable.
* `!r` shows the track in the message if start zone doesn't exist.
* Fixed HUD showing wrong time when playing with timescale.
* Fixed checkpoints not properly setting `targetname` and `classname`.
* Fixed error when certain commands are used from the server's console. This fix allows them to work now.
* Changed `!deleteall` so you can delete all records per-style rather than just per-track.
* Fixed an issue where *deleted* replays would not be overwritten.
* Added cooldown for replay playback/stop for non-admin users.
* Fixed replay bots breaking at certain interactions; such as stopping playback between the replay's end and its nullification and then requesting new playback.
* Improved smoothness of all replay playback.
* Fixed a bug that caused the last frame of replays seem out-of-place.

# API

* Added natives:
  * `Shavit_ChangeClientStyle`
  * `Shavit_ReloadLeaderboards`
  * `Shavit_DeleteReplay`
  * `Shavit_GetOrderedStyles`
  * `Shavit_IsPaused`

* Added forwards:
  * `Shavit_OnRankAssigned`

A relatively big update considering it's a minor version, have fun!



# v2.4.0 - asdf - 2019-02-02 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.4.0
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/1cd4b4c9c364cdade32456e7caa65ebc07528bd9

## Note: bhoptimer now requires SourceMod 1.10 or above.

* Revamped HUD for CS:GO. CS:GO HUD has been technically modified so it is easier to manipulate for developers.
* Restructured the whole plugin to use `enum struct`. Code should be easier to understand. As far as I'm aware other modules should not break. However, they will need to be modified if a recompilation is desired.
* Fixed chat colors in CS:GO.
* Deprecated `Shavit_GetPlayerPB` and `Shavit_GetWRTime`. Use `Shavit_GetClientPB` and `Shavit_GetWorldRecord` respectively.
* Added `shavit_rankings_weighting` cvar. This allows you to control the weighting in rankings. Set this to `1.0` to disable weighting and instead give users the exact amount of points shown in record submenus.
* Changed `users.name` collation to `utf8mb4_general_ci`. This is not an automatic migration and will require manual action for existing installations.
* Added `shavit_core_nochatsound` to get rid of the chat ticking sound from timer messages.
* Fixed exploit in chat plugin that allowed breakage of the chat in CS:S.
* Fixed RTLer not working in chat plugin.
* Fixed attempts to teleport a kicked/non spawning central bot resulting in logged errors and paused script execution.
* Changed !hud so it is easier to understand for the end-user. The menu now also has new settings that allow you to disable the main HUD's components individually.
* Added commands to toggle frequently changed HUD components. *!keys, !master, !center, !zonehud, !hideweapon, !truevel*
* Fixed exploit allowing users to submit segmented runs as if they were done in realtime.
* Fixed server crash exploit with checkpoints.

https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/3e558558b003bd7e504fdc0ce9528ce0cbe383d3

* **Added support for segmented runs.** Use `"specialstring" "segments"` to allow a style to use segmented checkpoints. Use the !cp menu on supported styles! Segmented styles also work with replays.
* **Fixed multiple memory leaks.**
* Added Segmented (normal) as a style to the default setup.
* Added `shavit_replay_botshooting`. This cvar can allow you to disable attacking buttons for bots. 0 will make the bots not press mouse1/mouse2 at all. 1 will only allow shooting, 2 will only allow right clicking and 3 will allow everything.
* Added two natives: `Shavit_HijackAngles`, `Shavit_GetPerfectJumps`.
* Fixed a bug with replay data when loading a state after finishing the map.
* Now `mp_humanteam` is respected by shavit-misc. The TF2 equivalent also is.
* Now `shavit_replay_defaultteam` is always respected, regardless of if the map has a spawn point for the team.
* Rewrote admin menu integration. Use the `shavit_admin` override to grant access. The *Timer Commands* category now has replay removal too.
* Now weapons dropped by disconnected players will automatically clean up.
* Added record count in !delete menu, disabled buttons when unnecessary.
* Added perfect jump% measuring for scroll styles.



# v2.0.3 - small updates - 2018-04-29 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.0.3
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/c294408c431f315730e0bc71248009d74c1ddc73

* Added style permissions:
   - Added `Shavit_HasStyleAccess` native.
   - Added `permissions` setting to styles. Use like "p;style_tas" for example. First section is the flag needed, and the second section is the override for it.
* Micro optimization in spawn point generation.
* Scaled slide zones with speed/gravity.
* Reworked sounds to emit properly in CS:GO.
* Fixed typos in the code, and translations. Thanks @strafe!
* Fixed an issue where players get a wrong rank when actually unranked. Thanks Nairda for finding this!



# v2.0.2 - begone, bugs! - 2018-04-19 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.0.2
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/a0665072139c16aaac355953404982709f9ba816

* Addressed CP menu bugs.
* Addressed an issue where donor plugins not always allowing players to use custom titles.
* Addressed an issue that caused chat titles to not always show.
* Fixed CS:S HUD not showing track properly.
* Fixed pre-zoned maps not saving spawn points if you just started the server.
* Removed duck/unduck requirement for checkpoints. Upon teleporting, the plugin will automatically adjust you to the state of the checkpoint.
* Fixed the 'to X rank' parameter when using percentile ranking in titles.
* Reworked gun shot muting. Now it supports TF2, and I've fixed the issue that caused others' gun shots to not play at all in CS:GO.
* Added `shavit_core_defaultstyle`. Usage: style ID. Add an exclamation mark as the prefix to ignore style cookies (i.e. "!3" to force everyone to play scroll when they join).



# v2.0.1 - bug fixes - 2018-03-23 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.0.1
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/c28de91fd4a1a153099c7adc1b95d4be0453ce00

* Fixed not being able to change the teleport zones' track on creation.
* Fixed CS:S HUD not showing irregular tracks.
* Fixed HUD breaking apart after adding styles without server restarts.
* Removed minimum for `shavit_timelimit_default`.



# v2.0.0 - official release! - 2018-03-18 - shavit
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v2.0.0
https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/commit/f9b67450db01c1954d28dd36fe2e9ab96c45c11c

We're out of beta now!
The last release was in September 21, 2015. There have been **too many** changes, but I'll try to mention the important ones.

* Added configuration files.
* There are multiple styles now. They're defined in `addons/sourcemod/configs/shavit-styles.cfg`.
* The database structure has been revamped. Visit [the wiki page](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/wiki/4.2.-Extra:-Updating-(Database)) for information.
* Added cvars for most features.
* Created a website for bhoptimer. See https://bhop.online/
* Revamped the whole zones plugin. You can setup aesthetic looking zones thanks to grid snapping, wall snapping and cursor zoning.
* Added many zone types: No speed limit, teleport zone, easybhop zone, slide zone.
* You can now choose the zone sprite.
* You can now edit zones after creating them. This includes manual editing of coordinations.
* The plugin has received massive optimizations. It's very lightweight now.
* Added a stats module. The main command is !stats (or !profile), it shows lots of useful information.
* Added a dynamic timelimits module. It sets the timelimit for the map relatively to the average completion time.
* Added replay bots. By default, there's a single bot that players can choose to playback with, the command is !replay. The recorded data is saved in an efficient structure (binary, rather than UTF) to make sure the server doesn't hiccup when data is saved.
* Added a rankings module. The design idea is simple: points given per record are relative to the map's length, tier and how good the record is compared to the rank 1 record. The style played also affects the amount of points given.
* Added bonus track.
* Added logging for admin actions.
* Added chat module. It integrates with rankings and allows players to use custom titles if they have access. See !chatranks and !cchelp.
* The target version is now SourceMod 1.9 as it offers functionality needed for accurate timing.
* Added checkpoints. You can save while spectating players or bots too. Teleporting will make sure you're at the exact same state you were in while saving (including timer data), so that you can't segment an impossible to achieve record.
* Added automatic integration with KZ maps with buttons, and the [Fly zoning standard](https://github.com/3331/fly).
* Added `+strafe` detection.
* Added strafe/sync counters.
* Added custom `sv_airaccelerate` values for styles.
* Added the ability to have custom physics for styles (i.e. HSW, SHSW, W-only etc).
* Made prespeed/prejump limitations more user-friendly.
* Added CS:S support.
* Added TF2 support.
* Fixed zones not rendering after a certain number.
* Added the !hud command, it allows players to make their HUD contain the information they want to see.
* Added commands to teleport to the end zones (!end, !bend).
* Added team join hooks for comfortable spawning.
* Added spectator lists.
* Redone player hiding.
* Added player teleportation.
* Added weapon commands (!usp, !glock, !knife) and ammo management.
* Added noclip commands (!p, !nc, +noclip etc).
* Allowed dropping all weapons.
* Added godmode.
* Added custom prespeed limitations.
* Removed clutter (like team changes) from chat.
* Hid radar.
* Changed weapons to disappear when dropped.
* Added auto-respawn.
* Added radio commands blocking.
* Added scoreboard manipulation (clan tags, score/deaths etc).
* Added configurable chat advertisements.
* Added player ragdoll removal.
* Added fuzzy search in !wr (so you can write `!wr arcane` rather than `!wr bhop_arcane_v1` for example).
* Added !rr command to see the recent world records.
* Fixed all reported bugs.

https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/1.3b

The update should (SHOULD, not promising anything!) also make remote MySQL databases work, even though I'm really against them and they could make the server lag hard.
And it also fixes many of the SQL issues that some server owners had.
